# ObsidianPlugin
A Template Repository for building [Obsidian](https://github.com/Naamloos/Obsidian) plugins. Make sure to rename the assemblies to ensure compatibility with other plugins.

## Obsidian.Api.dll reference
You need the Obsidian.API dll to be able to develop plugins. This template repository has the myget feed pre-setup.
1. Add Obsidian.Api to your references.
2. Open your `.csproj` file.
3. Find the reference to `Obsidian.Api`.
4. Add the following node as a child to that property: `<Private>false</Private>`.

## Myget reference
Instead of directly referencing the DLL we can also pull it from myget for a quick streamlined dev environment. This template repository has the package reference set up for you, so you only need to add the package source.
1. Add `https://www.myget.org/F/obsidian/api/v3/index.json` to your Package sources.
2. Search for `Obsidian.Api` on Nuget.
3. Install the latest version.
4. Open your `.csproj` file.
5. Make sure the package reference looks like this:
```
<PackageReference Include="Obsidian.API" Version="1.0.110" ExcludeAssets="runtime">
  <Private>false</Private>
</PackageReference>
```
What's important here is that you include the `ExcludeAssets` parameter and the `Private` node. This will make sure Obsidian will use it's own Obsidian.Api assembly.

### Myget on CI?
Use the following two pre-build commands:
```
nuget sources add -Name Obsidian-Myget -Source https://www.myget.org/F/obsidian/api/v3/index.json
nuget restore
```
